# Horiseon
This is my first homework assignment from my coding certificate program. We were given demo files of an SEO company called "Horiseon" to work with. We worked on HTML semantics and cleaning up the CSS. 

## Changes I made to the HTML.

1. Added space between the "div"s in the "body" to make it easier to read. 
2. Changed the title from “website” to “Horiseon”
3. Noted the “Header,” “Navbar,” “Body,” “Sidebar,” & “Footer.” 
4. Added an aria-label to the “hero” image. 
```
I wanted to add descriptive text for it and didn’t 
know how to till I watched a replay of the office 
hours. In it, our teacher demo’d how that can add 
descriptive text where you can’t use alt text. 
```
5. Turned the “div” header into a “header”. 
6. Added image descriptions for “body” images. 
7. Removed an unnecessary img tag from the “Cost Management” graphic. 
8. Updated the copyright to 2020.
9. Created a new “div class” to replace repeating “div classes” in the “Sidebar.” section. 
10. Removed unnecessary “div id” tags from two of the boxes inside the “content” box.

## Changes I made to the CSS.

1. Added notes to style.css.
2. Removed list style type from “.header div ul”.
3. Rearranged “a” and “p” font styles to above the “.content” style to create better flow of information. 
4. Consolidated styles for “Sidebar” boxes to target the new “div class” I made for index.html. 
5. Rearranged style order so that the styles for boxes inside the “content” box follow the styles of the “content” box. Prior to this, the order was: 
    * .content
    * .benefits
    * boxes inside .benefits box
    * boxes inside .content box
6. Changed the blue background for boxes to one color of blue.
