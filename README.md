# Horiseon
This is my first homework assignment from my coding certificate program. We were given demo files of an SEO company called "Horiseon" to work with. Our assignment was to work on HTML semantics, clean up the CSS and present a working website. 

## My Worflow
<br>

### 1. Clean up and consolidation.

    a) Added rows to separate areas to make the HTML easier to read. 
    b) Noted the header, navbar, body, sidebar and footer areas inside index.html. 
    c) Commented on each section inside style.css. 
    d) Added alternative text to all images and clip art.
    e) Removed unnecessary tags and styles.
    f) Turned "div header" into a "header". 
    g) Created a new div classes called "content-boxes" and "benefit-box" to consolidate code.
    h) Consolidated my css styles to target my new div classes. 
    i) Rearranged some sections inside style.css to have style sections in relevant areas.
        • "a" and "p" font styles were moved above the ".content" style.
        • "content-boxes" placed after ".content".
        • "benefit-box" placed after ".benefit".

### 2. My modifications.
<br> 

    a) Changed the website title from “website” to “Horiseon Marketing."
    b) Added an aria-label to the "hero" image. 
        I wanted to add descriptive text for it and didn’t know how to till I watched a replay 
        of the office hours. In it, our teacher demo’d how that can add descriptive text where 
        you can’t add descriptive text. 
        
    c) Added names to my h2 sections inside "content-boxes" and linked them to my Navbar. 
    d) Changed the font size in "p" to make it easier to read. 
    e) I changed the blue in the "content-boxes" and "benefit-box" to match the blue in the "Navbar". This made the text in the boxes easier to read for me and it happened to match the jean jacket in the "hero" image. 
    f) Updated the copyright to 2020.
