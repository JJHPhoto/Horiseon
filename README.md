# Horiseon
This is my first homework assignment from my coding certificate program. We were given demo files to go over. We worked on HTML semantics and cleaning up the CSS. 

Changes I made to the HTML

1. Added space between the "div"s in the "body" to make it easier to read. 
2. Changed the title from “website” to “Horiseon”
3. Noted the “Header,” “Navbar,” “Body,” “Sidebar,” & “Footer.”
